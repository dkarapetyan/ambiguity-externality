<p>
    <br> The first task in Part 2 will be the same encryption task as in Part 1. In this task, you will be shown a 5-letter word that you will encode into 5 numbers.  After you finish encoding a word, the computer program will prompt you with another word to encode. Once you encode that word, you will be given another word, and so on.</br>
    <br>This process will continue for 8 minutes (480 seconds).</br>
    <br><b>Part of your bonus payment will be determined by your performance in this task</b>.</br>
    <br><b><u>Roles</u></b>
    <br>The yellow players in Part 2 <b>may or may not</b> have their tokens decreased by 1 each time a blue player correctly encodes a word.</br>
    <br>Similar to Part 1, yellow players cannot take away any tokens from blue players.</br>
    <br><b><u>Token Earnings</u></b></br>
    <br>Each correct answer will add 2 tokens to your score, and will be equal to an <b>additional bonus payment</b> of up to £.10 per word encoded with a potential maximum of 64 tokens earned equal to <b>£3.20</b>. Each incorrect answer will not add any tokens to your score.</br>
